# Priority Rules
1. **Architecture:** Follow the patterns defined in `.context/02_architecture/`.
2. **Style:** Adhere strictly to `.context/03_standards/coding_style.md`.
3. **Security:** Review `.context/05_security/` before writing sensitive logic.
4. **Testing:** All new code must be accompanied by tests as defined in `.context/06_testing/`.
