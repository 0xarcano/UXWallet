| **Name** | UXWallet Smart Contracts (Multi-Chain Vaults). |
| **Purpose** | Secure custody and rule enforcement for a UX-focused, non-custodial, chain-agnostic wallet + aggregated liquidity protocol. Allows high-speed rebalancing via Nitrolite state updates while protecting the user's principal through an on-chain "Force Withdrawal" escape hatch. |
| **Target Users** | Web3 medium and advanced users. |
| **MVP Chains** | Yellow L3 + Ethereum + Base. |

## Core Value Proposition

- **Secure custody:** Protocol-owned vaults hold user assets with trustless execution guarantees.
- **Non-custodial:** Users retain ultimate control via Force Withdrawal escape hatch.
- **Fast settlement:** Off-chain state updates via Nitrolite (ERC-7824) for real-time UX.
- **Atomic guarantees:** Execution Guard ensures funds only move when counterpart is confirmed (intent fulfillment).
- **Hybrid exits:** Treasury can sponsor withdrawals when local vault liquidity is insufficient.
