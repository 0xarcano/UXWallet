# User Stories

- As a user, I want to sign once (delegate / Session Key) and have my funds earn yield without further pop-ups (Flywheel Solver fulfills intents).
- As a user, I want to see one unified balance regardless of which chain my funds are on.
- As a user, I want to delegate assets to the pool and have the Solver use them (and Treasury) to fulfill intents; I get 50% of the rewards.
- As a user, I want to send to a third party (same-chain or cross-chain); when the pool has liquidity it fulfills (best fee), otherwise the system uses LiFi (Treasury-sponsored when applicable).
- As a user, I want to withdraw my principal plus my 50% reward share; I want a way to exit even when the pool on my target chain is dry (LiFi/Treasury-sponsored path).
- As a user, I want to see the yield (my 50% share) credited to my balance.
