### Phase 0 — Foundation
- **US-01:** As a user, I want to sign once (delegate / Session Key) and have my funds earn yield without further pop-ups.
- **US-08:** As a new user, I want a guided onboarding that explains Flywheel and gets me set up quickly (Connect → Delegate → Select Tokens → Unify).

### Phase 1 — Core wallet
- **US-02:** As a user, I want to see one unified balance per asset regardless of which chain my funds are on, updated in real-time.
- **US-07:** As a user, I want to see my unified balance with generated yield information and a Yield Badge.

### Phase 2 — Liquidity unification
- **US-03:** As a user, I want to unify my fragmented balances from multiple chains into the vault in one click.
- **US-09:** As a user, I want to add liquidity into Flywheel with a clear preview of amounts, fees, and outcomes.

### Phase 3 — Send / Withdraw
