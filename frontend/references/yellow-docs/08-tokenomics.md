| **Total Offer Amount** | USD $100,000,000 |
| **Supply Model** | Fixed (no inflation, no burn) |

## Supported Networks

$YELLOW operates as an ERC-20 token across multiple blockchain networks:

| Network | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Ethereum | Live |
| Base | Live |
| Arbitrum | Live |
| Linea | Live |
| BNB Chain | Live |
| Polygon | Live |

## Token Utility

$YELLOW is the universal access and coordination token for the Yellow Network. It powers all economic activity across applications, brokers, and liquidity nodes.

### Core Utilities

| Utility | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Access Rights** | Required to operate nodes, brokers, or integrations on the Yellow Network |
| **Feature Unlocking** | Premium tiers and advanced services depend on staking thresholds |
| **Governance Rights** | Staked YELLOW grants voting power over network parameter changes |
| **Rewards** | Node operators and delegators earn rewards for reliable service; penalties for misconduct |
| **Collateral** | Used as collateral to incentivize good behavior and compensate operators |
| **Staking** | Integral to the staking framework enhancing network security and trust |

### Specific Use Cases

- **Broker registration** — Required to register as a broker on the network
- **Channel activation** — Needed to activate state channels
- **Yellow App Store access** — Access and publish apps
- **SDK access** — Premium SDK features
- **Transaction fees** — Protocol-level transaction fees
- **In-app subscriptions** — Off-chain subscription services
- **App Store commissions** — Yellow App Store commissions

## Payment Abstraction System

The Yellow Payment Layer allows users to pay network fees in **any major asset** (USDT, ETH, BTC, fiat), not just $YELLOW:

### How It Works

1. User pays fee in any supported currency (e.g., USDT)
2. An automated conversion mechanism transparently swaps the payment into $YELLOW on the open market
3. Users who pay directly in $YELLOW receive **discounted fees**
4. All converted fees are directed into the **Strategic Reserve**

### Benefits

- **Frictionless adoption** — Users don't need to hold $YELLOW for routine interactions
- **Organic buy-side demand** — Every fee payment creates market demand for $YELLOW
- **Incentive alignment** — Direct $YELLOW payment is rewarded with discounts

```
User pays in USDT ──> Auto-convert to $YELLOW ──> Strategic Reserve
User pays in $YELLOW (discount) ──────────────────> Strategic Reserve
```

## Strategic Reserve

The Strategic Reserve holds **100% of protocol revenue in $YELLOW**. It serves dual purposes:

### Stability Buffer

- Absorbs volatility without relying on inflationary emissions or destructive token burning
- Diversified asset portfolio reduces exposure to market fluctuations

### Growth Engine

- Funds network expansion and incentives
- R&D funding for protocol development
- Ecosystem programs and grants

### Revenue Sources

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Protocol-level transaction fees | Fees from clearing and settlement operations |
| Trading fees | Fees from trading activities |
| Yellow App Store commissions | Revenue from app marketplace |
| Off-chain subscription services | Premium service subscriptions |

## Fee Structure

Fees accumulate from several revenue streams across the ecosystem:

1. **Trading fees** — Maker/taker fees on trading operations
2. **Protocol-level fees** — Clearing and settlement fees
3. **Yellow App Store commissions** — Percentage on app transactions
4. **Off-chain subscriptions** — Premium service fees

All protocol fees converted into $YELLOW are directed into the Strategic Reserve. The treasury supports:
- Buy-back mechanism for $YELLOW tokens
- Diversified currency reserve for dispute resolution
- Operational funding

## Supply Model

$YELLOW has a **static supply** model:

- **Fixed cap**: 10,000,000,000 tokens — cannot be increased
- **No inflation**: No algorithmic issuance or dynamic minting
- **No token burn**: No protocol-based burning mechanism
- **No supply adjustment**: Unlike ARTs and EMTs, no active supply adjustment mechanism
- **Circulating supply changes**: Only from movements of locked reserve/internal allocations to open market

This provides **transparency and predictability** in tokenomics.

## Governance

The governance model transitions through structured phases:

| Phase | Control Model | Participants |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Foundation-guided treasury management | Foundation + early stakeholders |
| **Phase 2** | Governance participation unlocked for verified stakers | Token holders who stake and verify identity/role |
| **Phase 3** | Full decentralized governance | Stakers collectively determine treasury use and protocol parameters |

### Governance Proposals May Include

- Staking requirements adjustment
- Rebalance of reserve tranches
- Ecosystem grants allocation
- Approval of partnerships and integrations
- Protocol upgrades and economic parameters

### Voting Power

Governance voting power increases with both:
- **Amount** of staked $YELLOW
- **Duration** of stake

This reinforces long-term commitment and ensures those who influence the network are economically aligned with its stability and growth.

## Staking (Planned)

Staking $YELLOW plays a central role in network security and coordination:

### Staking Use Cases

| Role | Staking Requirement |
|------|-------------------|
| ClearNode operator | Stake to activate role and permissions |
| Routing participation | Stake to participate in liquidity routing |
| App deployment | Stake to publish apps on Yellow App Store |
| Broker registration | Stake to register as a network broker |

### Staking Economics

- Stakers receive a share of **reserve-generated yield**
- Rewards are funded by the Strategic Reserve (not inflation)
- Penalties (slashing) for misconduct or underperformance
- Obligations enforced algorithmically through smart contracts
