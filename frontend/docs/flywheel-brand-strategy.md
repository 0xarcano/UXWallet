## 1. Brand Purpose

### Why Flywheel Exists

Flywheel exists to convert the wallet — the most commonly used Web3 tool — into a frictionless, non-custodial entry point to a novel Aggregated Liquidity Protocol that generates yield without compromising asset custody.

Today, a person who wants to hold and grow crypto must navigate fragmented balances across chains, understand gas mechanics on multiple networks, risk funds on bridges, endure relentless wallet pop-ups, and accept that idle assets earn nothing. Each of these friction points is a gate that filters out even experienced Web3 users. The result is a Web3 ecosystem that talks about empowerment but buries it under layers of unnecessary complexity.

Flywheel rejects this premise. The technology to solve these problems already exists — state channels for instant settlement, intent-based protocols for abstracted bridging, session keys for delegated authorization. What has been missing is the will to combine them into a product that puts the user's experience above the protocol's complexity. Flywheel is a non-custodial wallet and aggregated liquidity protocol: users delegate assets, the Flywheel Solver fulfills intents using the Aggregated Liquidity Pool (user assets + Flywheel Treasury), and rewards are split 50/50 between users and Treasury. User funds are always protected.

### The Movement: "The Radical Simplification of Web3"

Flywheel leads a movement built on a single conviction: **true blockchain innovation is not adding complexity — it is making complexity disappear.**

This is not dumbing down. This is engineering up. Every layer of abstraction in Flywheel — the Unified Balance, the Persistent Session Key, the Fast Exit Guarantee — represents a hard technical problem solved so the user never has to think about it. The radical act is not the technology itself; it is the decision to hide it.

We believe:

- **Simplicity is a feature, not a compromise.** The best crypto experience is one where the crypto part is invisible.
- **Power users deserve better tools.** Even medium and advanced Web3 users shouldn't need to manage liquidity across chains manually — that's a failure of infrastructure, not a badge of expertise.
- **Yield should be passive, not a full-time job.** People should not need a DeFi PhD to earn on their holdings.

## 2. Brand Vision

> "A world where your digital assets work for you, without you having to think about where they are."

Flywheel envisions a future where the concept of "chains" is as irrelevant to end users as TCP/IP is to someone checking email. Your money is yours. It grows. It moves when you tell it to. You never bridge, never switch networks, never pay gas, never sign more than once. The infrastructure exists to serve you — silently, securely, and continuously.

### Brand Roadmap

| Phase | Timeframe | Objective | Key Milestones |
|-------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Foundation** | Year 1–2 | Establish Flywheel as the UX benchmark for crypto wallets | MVP launch (Yellow L3 + Ethereum + Base), $500K TVL, 1,000 MAU, delegation completion rate >80%, "Set and Forget" positioning established in market |
| **Expansion** | Year 2–3 | Scale to become the default cross-chain wallet for passive holders | 10+ supported chains (Arbitrum, Ethereum, Linea, Polygon), $5M TVL, 10,000 MAU, brand awareness in top 10 wallet mentions, partner integrations |
| **Dominance** | Year 3–5 | Become the largest state channel liquidity aggregator | Largest aggregated liquidity pool via Yellow Network state channels, institutional partnerships, mobile-native experience, global brand recognition as the "anti-complexity" wallet |

---

## 3. Brand Mission

Flywheel's mission is to deliver the wallet Web3 promised but never built — one that is genuinely simple, provably secure, and silently productive.

### Three Commitments

**1. Simplify**
We absorb complexity so our users don't have to. Fragmented balances become one number. Multi-chain gas becomes zero gas. Endless signatures become one delegation. Every technical achievement is measured by how much friction it removes, not how much cleverness it displays.

**2. Protect**
We are non-custodial by architecture, not just by claim. Users retain their keys. Session keys are scoped and revocable. Force Withdrawal guarantees that even if our backend goes offline, funds are always recoverable on-chain. Security is not a feature we sell — it is a contract we honor.

**3. Generate Value**
We turn idle assets into working capital. User-delegated assets form the Aggregated Liquidity Pool (combined with the Flywheel Treasury), which the Flywheel Solver uses to fulfill intents in the LI.FI marketplace. 50% of profits flow directly to depositors as passive yield; 50% goes to the Flywheel Treasury (used as liquidity and for protocol operations). Users don't need to understand DeFi mechanics, liquidity pools, or impermanent loss. They deposit. They earn. That's it.

## 4. Brand Values

### 1. Radical Simplicity

**Definition:** Every product decision passes the "two-popup test" — if it requires more than two wallet pop-ups per session, it requires redesign.

Radical Simplicity is not minimalism for aesthetics. It is a relentless engineering discipline. The Unified Balance is radically simple because it aggregates multi-chain state channel positions, ClearNode WebSocket notifications, and real-time price feeds into a single number. Even for medium and advanced Web3 users — people who understand chains but are exhausted by managing them — the simplicity Flywheel delivers is the direct product of the complexity we've absorbed.

**In practice:**
- One balance, not per-chain breakdowns (with optional advanced toggle)
- One delegation, not per-action signatures
- One "Unify" action, not manual bridging across protocols
- Zero gas for internal transfers, not "buy ETH on Base first"

### 2. Transparent Trust

**Definition:** Show how it works, not just that it works.

Trust in crypto cannot be demanded — it must be earned through transparency. Flywheel explains every mechanism to users who want to understand, while never forcing understanding on those who don't. The Revenue Split Transparency shows exactly where yield comes from: 50% of intent-fulfillment rewards to users, 50% to the Flywheel Treasury (which serves as part of the Aggregated Liquidity Pool and funds operations). The Wallet Home explains the Flywheel Solver mechanism in plain language. The Force Withdrawal escape hatch exists because we trust our users' judgment over our own uptime.

**In practice:**
- Revenue split visible in the Yield Dashboard
- Session key scope and permissions viewable in Settings
- On-chain contract addresses published and verifiable
- "How it works" explainers at every major interaction point
- Force Withdrawal always accessible — because if you can't leave, you're not really in control

### 3. Autonomous Empowerment

**Definition:** "Set and Forget" does not mean "hand over and trust blindly."

Flywheel automates the tedious — rebalancing, gas management, intent fulfillment — while preserving the meaningful. Users delegate a scoped session key, not their wallet. They can revoke at any time. They can Force Withdraw by presenting their last signed state to the on-chain Adjudicator without backend cooperation. They can inspect on-chain checkpoints. Autonomy means the user chose to stop thinking about it, not that they lost the ability to.

**In practice:**
- Delegation is opt-in and revocable
- Session keys are scoped to vault-internal operations only
- Force Withdrawal bypasses the entire backend
- On-chain Adjudicator is the final arbiter, not Flywheel's servers
- Advanced users can toggle the per-chain breakdown at any time

### 4. Yield for Everyone

**Definition:** Passive yield should not require understanding DeFi to access.

The crypto industry has gatekept yield behind a wall of jargon: liquidity pools, impermanent loss, yield farming, APY vs. APR, composability risk. Flywheel replaces all of this with a single concept: your deposits join the Aggregated Liquidity Pool, the Flywheel Solver uses that pool to fulfill intents, and you earn 50% of the profits. No staking interfaces. No pool selection. No risk assessment quizzes. You deposit. You earn. The Yield Badge on your balance card shows it growing — inline with your balance (e.g., "1001.56 ETH (up 1.56 ETH)").

**In practice:**
- Yield generation requires zero user action after delegation
- "+$0.003 today" badge on the main balance — concrete, not abstract
- Tooltip explains the mechanism in one sentence, not a whitepaper
- Yield history chart shows actual earnings over time
- No yield farming UI, no pool selection, no APY comparison tables

### 5. Aggregated Liquidity as Infrastructure

**Definition:** Aggregated liquidity is not a marketing strategy — it is the economic engine.

Flywheel's revenue model is structurally communal. User-delegated assets combine with the Flywheel Treasury to form the Aggregated Liquidity Pool. The Flywheel Solver — a Just-In-Time bot running at off-chain speed using Yellow Technology — uses this pool to fulfill intents in the LI.FI marketplace. When the pool has liquidity on the target chain, the liquidity layer fulfills at the best fee. When it does not, the system creates intent orders in the LI.FI marketplace (funded from pool on source chains or Treasury-sponsored). More deposits mean more liquidity. More liquidity means more spread opportunities. More spreads mean more yield for depositors. This is a genuine economic flywheel where each user's participation directly strengthens the protocol for everyone.

**In practice:**
- Revenue model explained transparently: user deposits + Treasury form the Aggregated Liquidity Pool → Flywheel Solver captures spreads → 50% returns to users, 50% to Flywheel Treasury
- Aggregated Liquidity Pool size visible (aggregate TVL)
- Flywheel Treasury serves as both pool liquidity and operational funding; only withdrawable by system owners
- Sponsored Exit funded by the Flywheel Treasury — the protocol literally pays for your convenience

## 5. Brand Positioning

### Positioning Statement

> **For** medium and advanced Web3 users who are frustrated by fragmented balances, gas complexity, and idle assets,
> **who** want their crypto to grow without active management,
> **Flywheel is** a Non-custodial Aggregated Liquidity Wallet
> **that** unifies your assets across chains into a single yield-bearing balance with one delegation and zero gas.
> **Unlike** MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and other traditional wallets,
> **we** absorb all cross-chain complexity — bridging, gas, chain-switching, and rebalancing — so your crypto works for you while you do literally anything else. Your delegated assets form the Aggregated Liquidity Pool that the Flywheel Solver uses to fulfill intents, generating passive yield with funds always protected.

### Positioning Maps

#### Axis 1: UX Complexity vs. Protocol Innovation

```
                        High Protocol Innovation
                              │
                              │
                  Zerion       │    Flywheel ★
                              │
                              │
Low UX Complexity ────────────┼──────────── High UX Complexity
                              │
                              │
                  Rainbow      │    MetaMask
                              │
                              │
                        Low Protocol Innovation
```

- **Flywheel** occupies the upper-left quadrant: maximum protocol innovation (state channels, intent-based bridging, session keys) with minimum UX complexity (one balance, one signature, zero gas).
- **MetaMask** sits in the lower-right: low protocol innovation (basic send/receive, manual network switching) with high UX complexity (gas management, chain switching, frequent signing).
- **Rainbow/Zerion** reduce UX complexity but lack deep protocol innovation (no state channels, no yield, no session keys).

#### Axis 2: Yield Generation vs. User Custody Control

```
                        High Yield
                              │
                              │
               Centralized     │    Flywheel ★
               Exchanges       │
                              │
Low Custody ──────────────────┼──────────── High Custody
Control                       │              Control
                              │
               Custodial       │    MetaMask / Rainbow
               Yield           │
                              │
                        Low Yield
```

- **Flywheel** achieves both: passive yield generation (3–5% APY target) while maintaining full non-custodial control (Force Withdrawal, scoped session keys, on-chain Adjudicator).
- **Centralized exchanges** offer yield but at the cost of custody.
- **Traditional wallets** maintain custody but assets sit idle.

### New Category: "Non-custodial Aggregated Liquidity Wallet"

Flywheel does not compete in the existing "wallet" category. It creates a new one — a non-custodial wallet that doubles as an entry point to an Aggregated Liquidity Protocol:

| Traditional Wallet | Non-custodial Aggregated Liquidity Wallet |
|---|---|
| Stores assets passively | Puts assets to work via the Aggregated Liquidity Pool |
| Requires per-action signatures | Operates on a one-time delegated session key |
| Shows per-chain balances | Shows unified cross-chain balance with inline yield |
| User manages gas manually | Gasless transactions within Yellow L3 (sponsored by staked $YELLOW) |
| No yield on idle assets | Passive yield from Flywheel Solver (50% of intent-fulfillment rewards) |
| Bridging is a separate, risky action | Unification abstracts bridging entirely via ERC-7683 intents |
| Withdrawals depend on local liquidity | Fast Exit Guarantee: Direct Exit or Sponsored Exit (Hybrid) from any chain |

### Competitive Analysis

| Competitor | Strength | Weakness | Flywheel Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MetaMask** | Market dominance, browser extension ubiquity, developer ecosystem | Poor UX (gas management, chain switching, no yield), no cross-chain abstraction | One-time delegation, Unified Balance, gasless mode, Aggregated Liquidity Pool passive yield |
| **Coinbase Wallet** | Brand trust (Coinbase backing), fiat on-ramp, beginner-friendly onboarding | Still per-chain, still requires gas management, yield requires manual DeFi interaction | True chain abstraction, Flywheel Solver automatic yield, zero gas on Yellow L3 |
| **Rainbow** | Beautiful design, strong mobile UX, social features | Limited cross-chain capabilities, no yield mechanism, no state channels | Protocol-level innovation (state channels, session keys, Aggregated Liquidity Pool), yield generation |
| **Zerion/Zapper** | Excellent portfolio tracking, DeFi dashboard aggregation | Tracking-focused not action-focused, no native yield, complex DeFi interfaces | Not just tracking — actually doing. Assets work autonomously via the Flywheel Solver. |

## 6. Brand Personality

### Five Personality Traits

**1. Calm & Confident**
Flywheel does not shout, hype, or create urgency. It speaks with the quiet confidence of a product that knows it works. In a space dominated by "WAGMI" energy and moon promises, Flywheel is the adult in the room — not boring, but grounded. When something goes wrong, it doesn't panic; it explains clearly and offers a path forward.

**2. Resourceful & Pragmatic**
Flywheel solves real problems with real technology. It does not promise revolution — it delivers practical improvement. State channels are not mentioned because they sound impressive; they are used because they enable millisecond settlements. LI.FI is not integrated for partnership announcements; it is integrated because it solves the bridging problem. Every feature exists to solve a documented user pain point.

**3. Inclusive & Approachable**
Flywheel speaks to Alex (the medium experience user with 6–12 months in crypto) and Morgan (the DeFi power user) with equal respect. It never talks down, never assumes expertise beyond basic wallet usage, and never gatekeeps behind unnecessary jargon. Technical depth is available for those who seek it (the breakdown toggle, the revenue split panel, the Force Withdrawal docs) but never forced on those who don't.

**4. Protective but not Paternalistic**
Flywheel safeguards users without restricting them. Session keys are scoped — but you can revoke them. Sponsored Exits cover your bridge fees — but Force Withdrawal exists if you don't trust the backend. The Execution Guard monitors atomic arrivals — but you can inspect on-chain checkpoints yourself. User funds are always protected — never used for owner withdrawals. Protection is a safety net, not a cage.

**5. Realistic Optimist**
Flywheel believes Web3 can be better, and it is actively making it better — but it does not pretend the work is done. Yield targets are stated as ranges (3–5% APY), not guarantees. Risk disclosures are honest. The challenge period for Force Withdrawal is 24 hours, and the product says so clearly. Optimism grounded in transparency.

### Brand Personification

If Flywheel were a person, it would be a thoughtful financial advisor in their mid-30s who genuinely believes in crypto's potential but has zero patience for unnecessary complexity. They wear clean, simple clothes (not a suit, not a hoodie). They explain things clearly the first time and don't mind explaining again. They hand you an emergency key to their office — not because they expect to disappear, but because they think you should always have it. They track your portfolio's growth and text you a simple update: "Up $12 this week." No charts unless you ask.

### Brand Archetypes

**Primary: The Sage**
The Sage archetype seeks truth, understanding, and wisdom. Flywheel embodies this through its commitment to transparency (Revenue Split, contract verification, Force Withdrawal), its educational approach (jargon-free onboarding, yield mechanism explainers), and its conviction that informed users are better users.

- *Sage strength:* Turns complexity into clarity
- *Sage risk to avoid:* Being cold, detached, or overly intellectual
- *Flywheel application:* The Sage energy is warm and practical, not academic. "Here's how your yield works" not "Here's our state channel architecture"

**Secondary: The Caregiver**
The Caregiver protects and serves others. Flywheel embodies this through scoped session keys, Force Withdrawal escape hatches (via on-chain Adjudicator), the Sponsored Exit that covers your bridge fees from the Flywheel Treasury, and error states that reassure rather than blame. The product literally pays for your convenience from its own treasury — and user funds are always protected.

- *Caregiver strength:* Users feel genuinely protected
- *Caregiver risk to avoid:* Being smothering, paternalistic, or patronizing
- *Flywheel application:* Protective infrastructure is present but not emphasized. "Your funds are safe" appears when needed, not as a constant disclaimer.

**Tertiary: The Magician**
The Magician transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary. Flywheel transforms the frustrating multi-chain experience into a magical "it just works" moment. The Unification animation, the instant gasless transfers, the Yield Badge counting up in real-time — these are designed to create small moments of delight where complexity visibly disappears.

- *Magician strength:* Creates "wow" moments in an otherwise mundane UX
- *Magician risk to avoid:* Being seen as deceptive or opaque about how the "magic" works
- *Flywheel application:* Always pair the magic with accessible explanation. The Unified Balance is magical, but the breakdown toggle reveals the mechanics.

## 7. Brand Promise

### Core Promise

> "Sign once. Your balance unifies, earns yield, and is always available — no gas, no bridges, no worries."

This is not marketing aspiration. Every clause maps to a shipped product feature:

### Proof Points

| Promise Clause | Product Feature | PRD Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **"Sign once"** | EIP-712 Persistent Session Key — a single delegation signature enables all autonomous operations. No further wallet pop-ups for internal operations (rebalancing, Solver fulfillment). | US-01: One-Time Delegation |
| **"Your balance unifies"** | Unified Balance aggregates assets from Yellow L3 + Ethereum + Base into a single per-asset total with inline yield display (e.g., "1001.56 ETH (up 1.56 ETH)"), updated in real-time via ClearNode WebSocket `bu` notifications | US-02: Unified Balance View |
| **"Earns yield"** | Flywheel Solver runs as a Just-In-Time bot using the Aggregated Liquidity Pool to capture spreads in the LI.FI marketplace; 50% of intent-fulfillment rewards distributed to depositors as passive yield | US-07: Wallet Home |
| **"Always available"** | Fast Exit Guarantee: Direct Exit when local vault has liquidity, Sponsored Exit (Hybrid) when it doesn't — Flywheel Treasury sponsors the LI.FI bridge fee | US-04: Fast Exit Guarantee |
| **"No gas"** | P2P transfers within Yellow L3 execute off-chain via ClearNode `send_transfer` — zero gas cost (sponsored by staked $YELLOW), instant confirmation | US-05: Gasless P2P Transfers |
| **"No bridges"** | Unification Intent (ERC-7683) abstracts LI.FI bridging into a single "Unify" action with 4-stage progress tracking (pending → routing → confirming → complete) | US-03: Unification |
| **"No worries"** | Force Withdrawal escape hatch (present last signed state to on-chain Adjudicator), scoped session keys (vault-internal only), Execution Guard atomic arrival tracking. User funds are always protected — never used for owner withdrawals. | US-01, US-04, Appendix |

## 8. Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice Attributes

Flywheel's voice is consistent across all channels. It is who we are, not how we adapt to context (that is tone — see below).

#### 1. Clear

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| "Your assets from Base and Yellow L3 appear as one balance." | "Our multi-chain aggregation layer virtualizes asset positions across settlement layers." |
| "Send money instantly, no gas fees." | "Leverage our gasless L3 infrastructure for zero-cost peer-to-peer value transfer." |
| "You'll sign once to let Flywheel manage rebalancing." | "Execute an EIP-712 typed data delegation to instantiate a persistent session key." |
| Use concrete numbers: "3–5% APY" | Use vague qualifiers: "competitive yields" |

#### 2. Reassuring

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| "Your funds are safe on the source chain. Try again when you're ready." | "Transaction failed. Error code: 0x3f82a." |
| "This takes about 2 minutes. We'll show you every step." | "Please wait." |
| "You can always withdraw — even if our servers go offline." | "Our 99.9% uptime guarantee ensures continuous availability." |
| Name the specific safety mechanism | Make vague security claims |

#### 3. Empowering

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| "You're in control. Revoke access anytime from Settings." | "Don't worry, we'll take care of everything." |
| "Your deposits power the Aggregated Liquidity Pool and the Flywheel Solver." | "We generate yield for you." |
| "Check your on-chain checkpoint to verify." | "Trust us, it's all secured." |
| Give users tools to verify | Ask users to take your word for it |

#### 4. Honest

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| "Yield varies based on solver activity. Current estimate: 3–5% APY." | "Earn guaranteed passive income!" |
| "Force Withdrawal triggers a 24-hour challenge period." | "Instant withdrawal anytime!" |
| "Unification requires a small gas fee on the source chain (~$0.50 in ETH on Base)." | "Completely free! No costs ever!" |
| State limitations plainly | Hide caveats in fine print |

### Tone Variations by Context

The voice stays constant. The tone adapts:

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Marketing / Landing Page** | Aspirational but grounded | "One balance. All chains. Your crypto, working while you sleep." |
| **Onboarding** | Warm, encouraging, patient | "Great choice. Let's get your wallet set up — it only takes four steps." |
| **In-App Support** | Calm, solution-oriented | "The unification is taking longer than expected. Your funds are safe on Base." |
| **Social Media** | Conversational, witty, concise | "Your ETH is on five chains doing nothing. Ours is on one balance doing everything." |
| **Technical Documentation** | Precise, neutral, thorough | "The Persistent Session Key authorizes state channel updates scoped to vault-internal operations. It cannot authorize transfers to external addresses." |
| **Error States** | Reassuring first, informative second | "Connection lost. Don't worry — your funds are safe on-chain. We're reconnecting..." |
| **Yield / Financial Data** | Precise, understated, no hype | "This period: +$4.23 (0.08%). Lifetime: +$127.50." |

### Writing Style Guide

- **Sentence case** for all headings and UI labels (not Title Case, not ALL CAPS)
- **Active voice** over passive: "Flywheel unifies your balance" not "Your balance is unified by Flywheel"
- **Numbers:** Use digits for financial amounts ($4.23), spell out for small counts ("four steps")
- **Second person** ("you", "your") in user-facing copy — never "the user"
- **Short paragraphs** — 2-3 sentences maximum in UI copy
- **No exclamation marks** in product UI (reserve for celebratory moments like first yield earned)
- **Oxford comma** always
- **Contractions** allowed in marketing and social; avoided in legal and technical docs
- **Crypto-specific:** Always "crypto" (lowercase) not "Crypto"; "Web3" (capital W, number 3); "on-chain" / "off-chain" (hyphenated)

### Brand Vocabulary

Words and phrases to use versus avoid. This vocabulary creates consistency and reinforces the brand's positioning.

| Use | Avoid | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Unify / Unification** | Bridge / Bridging | Bridging implies risk and friction; unification implies convergence and simplicity |
| **Unified Balance** | Aggregated balance / Total balance | "Unified" is the brand's coined term — own it |
| **Delegate / Delegation** | Authorize / Give permission | Delegation implies a scoped, revocable act; "authorize" sounds permanent |
| **Passive yield** | Yield farming / Staking rewards | "Passive" emphasizes zero effort; "farming" implies active work |
| **Flywheel Solver** | Bot / Algorithm / Arbitrage engine | "Flywheel" connects yield to the protocol's economic engine; "solver" is the established DeFi term |
| **Flywheel Treasury** | Protocol treasury / Reserve fund | Named entity that receives 50% of rewards and serves as part of the Aggregated Liquidity Pool |
| **Aggregated Liquidity Pool** | Liquidity pool / Fund / Reserve | Precise term for the combined user-delegated assets + Flywheel Treasury used by the Solver |
| **Gasless** | Fee-free / Zero-fee | "Gasless" is specific to the pain point being solved; "fee-free" is generic |
| **Session key** | API key / Auth token | Accurate technical term that conveys scoped, temporary access |
| **Set and Forget** | Autopilot / Automated / Hands-free | "Set and Forget" is the brand's signature phrase — always capitalize |
| **Force Withdrawal** | Emergency exit / Panic button | Precise, confident, non-alarming; user presents last signed state to on-chain Adjudicator |
| **Fast Exit Guarantee** | Withdrawal guarantee / Exit assurance | Named guarantee covering both Direct Exit and Sponsored Exit paths |
| **Direct Exit** | Normal withdrawal / Standard exit | When local vault has sufficient liquidity — instant via state channel close |
| **Sponsored Exit (Hybrid)** | Cross-chain exit / Routed withdrawal | When local vault is empty — Flywheel Treasury sponsors the LI.FI bridge fee |
| **Custody Contract** | Smart contract / Vault | On-chain contract (Yellow Smart Account / Nitrolite) where delegated funds are locked |
| **Your funds are safe** | Don't worry | Specificity reassures; vague comfort feels hollow |
| **User funds always protected** | We protect your funds | Emphasizes architectural guarantee, not a company promise; user funds never used for owner withdrawals |
| **Earn** | Make money / Generate income | "Earn" is simple, honest, and non-hyperbolic |
| **Works for you** | Makes money while you sleep | Understated and sustainable; not "get rich" framing |

## 9. Master Narrative

### Origin Story

**The Tension**
There are 500 million crypto holders worldwide. Most of them have assets scattered across chains they barely understand, paying gas in tokens they didn't plan to buy, and watching their holdings sit idle while DeFi promises yield that requires a PhD to access. The more chains launch, the worse it gets. The more wallets people install, the more fragmented their experience becomes. Web3 was supposed to empower people. Instead, it created a new literacy barrier.

**The Insight**
The technology to solve this already exists. State channels can settle transactions in milliseconds. Intent-based protocols can abstract away bridging. Session keys can eliminate signature fatigue. The problem was never the technology — it was the assumption that users should adapt to the infrastructure, rather than the infrastructure adapting to users.

**The Solution**
Flywheel inverts the equation. Instead of asking users to learn chains, gas, bridges, and DeFi, Flywheel absorbs all of that complexity into a single product experience: connect, delegate once, select tokens, and unify — then see a single balance that shows your assets and yield inline (e.g., "1001.56 ETH (up 1.56 ETH)"). The infrastructure — Yellow Network state channels (ERC-7824), LI.FI intent protocol (ERC-7683), Persistent Session Keys, and the Aggregated Liquidity Pool — does the heavy lifting. The Flywheel Solver runs as a Just-In-Time bot at off-chain speed. The user does nothing. That's the point.

### The Movement: "The Set-and-Forget Generation"

Flywheel is not just building a product. It is building for a generation of crypto holders who refuse to accept that managing digital assets should be a second job.

**Three principles of the Set-and-Forget Generation:**

1. **"I should not need to know which chain my money is on."** Chain-agnostic balance is the baseline, not a premium feature.
2. **"My money should earn without me farming."** Passive yield from Flywheel Solver intent-fulfillment activity via the Aggregated Liquidity Pool — no pool selection, no impermanent loss calculations, no "harvest" buttons.
3. **"I should be able to leave whenever I want."** Non-custodial architecture with Force Withdrawal means your exit is guaranteed by code, not by a company's promise.

### Three Messaging Pillars

#### Pillar 1: "One Balance, All Chains"

The core product message. Addresses the most visible pain point (fragmented balances) and the most immediate "wow" moment (seeing assets unify).

**Key messages:**
- Your ETH on Ethereum, Base, and Yellow L3 appears as one number. Because it is one balance.

## 10. Visual Identity (Conceptual Direction)

### Design Philosophy

Flywheel's visual identity embodies the principle of **"engineered calm."** In a crypto landscape dominated by neon gradients, aggressive typography, and chaotic dashboards, Flywheel opts for quiet confidence. The visual language communicates: *this is a serious tool that treats your money with the respect it deserves.*

Dark mode is the primary presentation — it reflects the technical sophistication of the product, reduces eye strain for users monitoring balances, and creates a premium, focused environment.

### Typography

| Type | Font | Weight | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Headings** | Inter | 600 (Semi-Bold), 700 (Bold) | Page titles, section headers, hero text |
| **Body** | Inter | 400 (Regular), 500 (Medium) | Paragraph text, descriptions, UI labels |
| **Financial Data** | JetBrains Mono | 400 (Regular), 500 (Medium) | Balance amounts, addresses, transaction IDs, yield numbers |

**Rationale:**
- **Inter** is an open-source variable font designed specifically for computer screens. It has excellent legibility at small sizes, strong readability for UI text, and a neutral personality that doesn't compete with content.
- **JetBrains Mono** is a monospace font optimized for code and data. Its distinguishing feature for Flywheel is its clear differentiation of similar characters (0/O, 1/l/I) — critical for displaying crypto addresses and financial amounts accurately.

### Logo Concept: "Convergence"

**Concept:** Multiple lines (representing chains/assets) converging into a single central point (representing the Unified Balance). The motion is centripetal — pulling inward, not spreading outward. This visually captures the core product action: fragmented assets becoming one.

**Execution direction:**
- Clean, geometric linework — no gradients in the mark itself
- Works at 16px favicon size and 200px hero size
- The convergence point uses Electric Teal (`#00D4AA`) as the focal color
- Lines use Soft Slate (`#8892A0`) to Deep Space (`#0A1628`) gradient
- Wordmark: "Flywheel" in Inter Semi-Bold, with "Fly" in Electric Teal and "wheel" in Clean White (dark mode) or Deep Space (light mode)

### Imagery Style

- **Abstract data visualization** over literal crypto imagery (no coins, no rockets, no lambos)
- **Clean, geometric patterns** reflecting state channel architecture (parallel lines, nodes, convergence points)
- **Minimal illustrations** for onboarding and empty states — line-art style, using the brand palette
- **No stock photos** of people staring at phones or "hacker" imagery
- **Charts and data** treated as visual elements, not just functional — they reinforce the "your money is working" narrative

### Iconography

- **Library:** Lucide React (consistent with tech stack)
- **Style:** 1.5px stroke weight, rounded line caps
- **Custom icons** for brand-specific concepts:
  - Unified Balance: converging arrows
  - Yield: upward growth curve
  - Gasless: cancelled gas pump or lightning bolt
  - Delegation: key with checkmark
  - Force Withdrawal: shield with exit arrow

### Animation Philosophy

- **Purposeful, not decorative.** Every animation communicates state change.
- **Convergence animations** for Unification: assets visually flowing from chains into the unified balance
- **Count-up animations** for balance increases: the number incrementing to its new value
- **Subtle pulse** on the Yield Badge: indicating active earning without demanding attention
- **Progress animations** for multi-step flows: Unification 4-stage tracking (pending → routing → confirming → complete), Sponsored Exit routing
- **No loading spinners** where possible — use skeleton screens with the brand gradient
- **Duration:** 200-400ms for micro-interactions, 600-1000ms for state transitions
- **Easing:** ease-out for entrances, ease-in for exits, ease-in-out for position changes

### Dark Mode as Primary

Dark mode is the default and primary design surface. It is not an afterthought or a toggle — it is the intended experience.

**Rationale:**
- Aligns with the "Deep Space" brand aesthetic
- Reduces eye strain for users who check balances frequently
- Creates a premium, focused atmosphere befitting financial data
- Electric Teal (`#00D4AA`) has significantly higher visual impact on dark backgrounds
- Yield Glow gradient creates a more compelling effect on dark surfaces

Light mode exists as an accessibility option and uses Clean White (`#F8FAFB`) as the primary surface with Deep Space (`#0A1628`) text.

## 11. Brand Architecture

### Brand Model: Endorsed Brand

Flywheel operates as an independent product brand with an endorsement line to its infrastructure provider:

> **Flywheel** — Powered by Yellow Network

**Rationale:**
- Flywheel is user-facing (Flywheel Wallet); Yellow Network is infrastructure (state channels, ClearNode, Nitrolite/ERC-7824). Different audiences, different trust mechanisms.
- "Powered by Yellow Network" provides technical credibility without burdening users with infrastructure complexity.
- Yellow Network may power multiple products; Flywheel needs its own brand equity as a non-custodial wallet and Aggregated Liquidity Protocol.

### Five Key Brand Moments in the UI

These are the moments where brand identity is most visible and most important — where the user's emotional state is heightened and the product either earns trust or loses it.

#### 1. The Delegation Moment (First Signature)

**Context:** The user is about to sign an EIP-712 message that delegates a session key. This is the single most trust-sensitive moment in the entire experience.

**Brand expression:**
- Calm, spacious modal design — no visual clutter
- Human-readable explanation of exactly what they are authorizing
- Clear scope statement: "This key can only authorize vault-internal state updates. It cannot transfer funds to external addresses."
- Prominent "Revoke anytime" link visible before signing
- Post-signature confirmation: "Delegation active. Flywheel is now working for you." No further wallet pop-ups for internal operations.
- No celebratory animation here — this is a trust moment, not a fun moment

#### 2. The Unification Moment (Assets Converging)

**Context:** The user has triggered Unification and assets are moving from source chains into the Unified Balance. This is the first "wow" moment.

**Brand expression:**
- Convergence animation: visual representation of assets flowing from chains into a single point
- Unification Flow gradient (`#7C6FF0` → `#00D4AA`) on the progress bar
- Real-time status updates at each stage: "Submitting intent..." → "Routing..." → "Confirming..." → "Complete"
- Final state: balance count-up animation to the new unified total
- Subtle celebratory moment: Yield Badge appears for the first time
- Execution Guard confirmation: "Assets verified on-chain. Your Unified Balance is live."

#### 3. First Yield Visible

**Context:** The user sees their first yield credit in the Unified Balance. This is the moment the "Set and Forget" promise is proven.

**Brand expression:**
- Yield Badge activates with a gentle pulse: "+$0.003 today"
- Warm Gold (`#FFB547`) accent draws attention without alarm
- Brief tooltip: "Your deposits are earning. This is your 50% share of the Flywheel Solver's intent-fulfillment rewards."
- Yield Dashboard becomes populated: current APY, total earned, history chart
- Tone: understated pride, not celebration — "This is how it should work."

#### 4. First Gasless Send

**Context:** The user sends funds to a friend and realizes there was no gas fee.

**Brand expression:**
- Transfer confirmation: "Sent 5 USDC to 0xAbc...def"
- Prominent: "0 gas fees"
- Instant confirmation (milliseconds, not seconds)
- Contrast messaging: "On other wallets, this would have cost ~$0.15 in gas. Here: $0.00."
- This is a Magician archetype moment — delight through simplicity

### Onboarding Narrative (4 Steps)

The onboarding is a brand story told in four acts. Each step reduces perceived complexity and builds toward the payoff. Onboarding can be skipped and resumed later; progress is persisted in LocalStorage so the user doesn't restart on refresh.

#### Step 1: Connect — "Let's meet your wallet"

**Copy:** "Connect your wallet to get started. We support MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and WalletConnect."

**Psychology applied:**
- *Foot-in-the-door technique:* Start with a familiar, low-commitment action (wallet connection). Users have done this before. Reduce the perception that this is something new or risky.
- *Mere Exposure Effect:* The wallet connection modal uses standard patterns (RainbowKit). Familiarity breeds comfort.

**Brand moment:** After connection, immediately show detected balances across supported chains (Yellow L3, Ethereum, Base). This creates the setup for the Unification payoff.

#### Step 2: Delegate — "Sign once, then forget"

**Copy:** "Sign a delegation to let Flywheel manage rebalancing and yield automatically. This session key can only authorize vault-internal operations — it cannot transfer your funds to external addresses. You can revoke anytime."

**Psychology applied:**
- *Loss Aversion:* Frame what they gain (passive yield, gasless transfers, unified balance) before asking for the signature. The delegation is positioned as unlocking benefits, not granting permissions.
- *Commitment & Consistency:* Having completed Step 1 (connection), users are psychologically primed to continue the sequence. The progress indicator (2/4) reinforces momentum.

**Brand moment:** Post-signature: "Delegation active. Welcome to Set and Forget." No further wallet pop-ups for internal operations after this point.

#### Step 3: Select Tokens — "Choose what to unify"

**Copy:** "Select the tokens and source chains you want to consolidate into your Unified Balance."

**Psychology applied:**
- *Autonomy & Control:* Giving users a choice of what to unify reinforces the non-custodial promise. They are not forced to unify everything — they choose.
- *IKEA Effect:* Active selection creates investment. The user is configuring their experience, not passively accepting it.

**Brand moment:** Preview shows estimated received amounts after fees, estimated time, and route/intent details. Transparency builds trust before the final commitment.

#### Step 4: Unify — "Bring it all together"

**Copy:** "Tap Unify to consolidate your selected assets into your Unified Balance — one number, earning yield, always available."

**Psychology applied:**
- *Goal-Gradient Effect:* Step 4/4. The user is so close to completion that abandonment feels costlier than finishing. The progress bar is almost full.
- *IKEA Effect:* By completing all four steps, the user has invested effort into their Flywheel setup. This investment increases perceived value and reduces churn.

**Brand moment:** Convergence animation plays. Single confirmation triggers ERC-7683 intent via LI.FI SDK. 4-stage progress tracking (pending → routing → confirming → complete). Balance count-up to the unified total with inline yield display. Yield Badge appears. "Your Flywheel is live."

### Error States as Brand Moments

Error states are not interruptions — they are opportunities to demonstrate the brand's Reassuring and Protective qualities. Every error follows a three-part structure: **reassure → explain → resolve.**

| Error | Toast / Message | Tone |
|---|---|---|
| **Wallet connection timeout** | "Connection timed out. Your wallet might be busy — please try again." | Reassuring, non-blaming |
| **Delegation signing rejected** | "No worries. You can delegate later from Settings when you're ready." | Patient, no pressure |
| **Unification solver timeout** | "Unification is taking longer than expected. Your funds are safe on the source chain. We'll keep trying." | Reassuring, specific about fund safety |
| **WebSocket disconnected** | "Updating... We've lost connection to the network. Reconnecting." | Calm, transparent about what's happening |
| **Transfer failed** | "Transfer could not be completed: [specific reason]. Your balance is unchanged." | Honest, specific, confirms no loss |
| **Sponsored Exit delay** | "Your withdrawal is being routed through [chain] via Sponsored Exit. This takes a few extra minutes — no extra cost to you. Flywheel Treasury covers the bridge fee." | Informative, preemptively addresses cost concern |
| **Price feed unavailable** | "Market data is temporarily unavailable. Your token amounts are accurate — we'll restore prices shortly." | Distinguishes between what's working and what's not |
| **Insufficient balance for gas (source chain)** | "You need approximately $0.50 in ETH on Base to start the Unification. This is the only gas fee you'll pay." | Honest about the cost, frames it as one-time |

### Empty States as Brand Moments

Empty states are the first thing new users see. They should not feel empty — they should feel like an invitation.

| State | Message | CTA |
|---|---|---|
| **No deposits yet** | "Your Unified Balance is waiting. Connect and deposit to get started." | "Unify your assets" |
| **Detected external balances** | "You have 2.5 ETH on Base sitting idle. Unify it now and start earning." | "Unify now" |
| **No yield yet** | "$0.00 earned — yield begins when the Flywheel Solver captures its first spread via the Aggregated Liquidity Pool. Your deposits are fueling the engine." | "Learn how yield works" |
| **No transaction history** | "No transactions yet. Send your first gasless transfer to see your history come to life." | "Send funds" |
| **No active delegation** | "Delegate to unlock the full Flywheel experience: unified balance, passive yield, and gasless transfers." | "Delegate now" |

### Community Strategy

## 14. Brand Psychology

### Seven Applied Psychological Principles

#### 1. Loss Aversion

**Principle:** People feel losses approximately 2x more intensely than equivalent gains (Kahneman & Tversky).

**Application in Flywheel:**
- **Delegation framing:** Don't ask "Do you want to delegate?" — frame it as "Without delegation, your assets sit idle instead of earning 3–5% APY." The loss of potential yield is more motivating than the gain of a feature.
- **Unification CTA:** "You have 2.5 ETH on Base sitting idle" — "sitting idle" frames the current state as a loss, making Unification feel like recovering value rather than adding a feature.
- **Revocation friction (intentional):** The revoke flow includes a reminder of what will stop working: "Revoking will pause passive yield, gasless transfers, and autonomous rebalancing." This isn't dark pattern — it's honest information delivered in loss-framed language.

#### 2. Mere Exposure Effect

**Principle:** Familiarity breeds preference. The more people encounter something, the more they tend to like it.

**Application in Flywheel:**
- **Wallet connection modal:** Use standard patterns (RainbowKit/wagmi) that users have seen in dozens of dApps. The first interaction should feel familiar, not novel.
- **Yield Badge persistence:** The Yield Badge is always visible on the main balance card. Even if the user ignores it initially, repeated exposure normalizes the concept of passive yield.
- **Brand vocabulary repetition:** Consistently use "Unified Balance," "Set and Forget," "Flywheel Solver," "Aggregated Liquidity Pool," and "Fast Exit Guarantee" across all touchpoints until these terms feel native.

#### 3. IKEA Effect

**Principle:** People value things more when they've invested effort in creating or configuring them.

**Application in Flywheel:**
- **4-step onboarding as investment:** Each completed step (Connect → Delegate → Select Tokens → Unify) represents user effort. By Step 4, the user has invested enough that the completed setup feels personally valuable.
- **Watched Unification:** The convergence animation during Unification makes the user witness their assets coming together. They didn't just click a button — they watched their balance unify. This visual participation creates ownership of the result.
- **Optional customization:** Preferences (theme, default withdrawal chain, slippage tolerance) let users configure their Flywheel. Even small personalization increases attachment.

#### 4. Zero-Price Effect

**Principle:** People disproportionately prefer free options, even when a low-cost alternative offers better value (Ariely).

**Application in Flywheel:**
- **"0 gas fees" messaging:** Gasless transfers are not just "low cost" — they are specifically and prominently "$0.00." The zero-price effect makes this dramatically more appealing than "$0.01."
- **Transfer confirmation design:** "Sent 5 USDC to 0xAbc...def — 0 gas fees." The gas fee amount is shown as a line item that reads $0.00, not simply omitted. Showing the zero is more powerful than not showing anything.
- **Sponsored Exit (Hybrid):** "No extra fees — the Flywheel Treasury covers bridging costs." The treasury-sponsored bridge fee is framed as a zero-cost benefit to the user, not just an infrastructure optimization. Clear UI indicator shows "Direct Exit" vs "Sponsored Exit (Hybrid)".

#### 5. Status-Quo Bias

**Principle:** People prefer the current state of affairs and resist change, even when change would benefit them.

**Application in Flywheel:**
- **Addressing the bias directly:** Alex (the medium experience user) uses MetaMask. Switching wallets feels risky. Flywheel addresses this by not requiring wallet replacement — users keep their existing wallet and connect it to Flywheel. The status quo (MetaMask) is preserved; Flywheel layers on top.
- **Delegation as enhancement, not change:** "You're not giving up your wallet. You're upgrading what your wallet can do." The session key adds capabilities without replacing the user's existing setup.
- **Force Withdrawal as continuity:** "If anything changes, you can always go back to the way things were. Force Withdraw to your original wallet, no questions asked." This reassures users that the status quo is always recoverable.

#### 6. Goal-Gradient Effect

**Principle:** People accelerate behavior as they approach a goal (the coffee card effect — people buy more frequently as they near the free coffee).

**Application in Flywheel:**
- **4-step onboarding with visible progress:** The progress bar (1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4) creates a visible goal. Step 4 has the highest completion rate because users are closest to the finish.
- **Unification progress tracking:** The 4-stage progress indicator ("Submitting..." → "Routing..." → "Confirming..." → "Complete") creates a visible goal-gradient during the Unification flow. Each completed stage increases the user's emotional investment in seeing it through.
- **Yield milestones:** Future consideration — create micro-milestones ("First $1 earned," "First $10 earned," "First $100 earned") that create a sense of progression and acceleration.

#### 7. Commitment & Consistency

**Principle:** Once people commit to a position or action, they feel internal pressure to behave consistently with that commitment (Cialdini).

**Application in Flywheel:**
- **Progressive commitment funnel:** Connect (low commitment) → Delegate (medium commitment) → Select Tokens (medium-high commitment) → Unify (high commitment). Each step is consistent with the previous one, and each makes the next feel natural rather than escalatory.
- **Delegation as identity commitment:** After delegating, the user has implicitly committed to the "Set and Forget" philosophy. The Yield Dashboard, the Unified Balance, and the gasless transfers all reinforce this identity. Revoking would be inconsistent with the choice they've already made.
- **Consistent language:** The brand uses "Set and Forget" as a consistent identity label. Users who adopt this phrase internally are more likely to stay committed to the product that embodies it.

### Trust-Building Strategies (Three Levels)

#### Level 1: Transparency Trust

Trust built through radical openness about how things work.

| Strategy | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Revenue split disclosure** | 50/50 split visible in Yield Dashboard — users see exactly where their yield comes from and where the other 50% goes |
| **Contract address publication** | All on-chain contract addresses published and verifiable on block explorers |
| **Session key scope display** | Settings page shows exactly what the session key can and cannot do, with on-chain verification links |
| **Open-source components** | SDK and protocol contracts are open-source (Yellow Network GitHub) |
| **Honest limitation disclosure** | "Unification requires ~$0.50 in gas on the source chain" — don't hide the one gas cost that exists |

#### Level 2: Experience Trust

Trust built through consistent, reliable product behavior over time.

| Strategy | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Balance consistency** | Unified Balance matches sum of per-chain breakdown — always. Zero discrepancy tolerance. |
| **Yield accuracy** | Yield Badge shows actual earned amounts, not estimates. Numbers are precise ("+$0.003") not rounded ("~$0"). |
| **Error honesty** | When things go wrong, say so clearly: "Unification is taking longer than expected." Don't hide behind vague "loading" states. |
| **Uptime reliability** | WebSocket reconnection with backoff, polling fallback, "Last updated X seconds ago" indicators. Never show stale data as current. |
| **Safe error recovery** | "Your funds are safe on the source chain" — state this explicitly every time something fails during a cross-chain operation. |

#### Level 3: Community Trust

Trust built through collective validation and social proof.

| Strategy | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Public yield reports** | Monthly yield transparency reports shared on Twitter and Discord — community can verify solver performance |
| **Aggregated Liquidity Pool concept** | "Your deposits join the Aggregated Liquidity Pool that powers the Flywheel Solver" — yield is a collective achievement, not a corporate payout |
| **Open feedback channels** | Discord #product-feedback with visible team responses. Users see that feedback leads to changes. |
| **TVL as social proof** | Aggregate TVL displayed (when significant) — "X users trust Flywheel with $Y in assets" |
| **Bug bounty transparency** | Security findings and resolutions communicated openly (without exposing vulnerabilities before patching) |

### Anxiety Reduction Techniques in the UI

| Anxiety Source | Reduction Technique |
|---|---|
| **"Am I about to lose my funds?"** (Delegation) | Show session key scope explicitly. Display "Cannot transfer to external addresses" prominently. Show "Revoke anytime" link. |
| **"Where did my money go?"** (Unification in progress) | 4-stage progress indicator with real-time status. "Your funds are on [chain]" shown at every stage. Execution Guard confirmation at completion. |
| **"Is this real yield or too good to be true?"** | Show actual dollar amounts (not inflated APY projections). Explain the mechanism in one sentence. Revenue Split panel shows the math. |
| **"What if Flywheel disappears?"** | Force Withdrawal always accessible. On-chain contract addresses verifiable. "Your funds are on-chain, secured by [network] — not by us." |
| **"I don't understand what I just signed"** | Human-readable EIP-712 display. Post-signature explainer: "Here's what your delegation authorizes." Settings shows active scope. |
| **"Is my balance actually correct?"** | Breakdown toggle shows per-chain distribution. Amounts match on-chain state. "Last updated X seconds ago" with real-time WebSocket connection indicator. |

### Making "Passive Yield" Feel Trustworthy (7 Tactics)

Passive yield is Flywheel's most powerful differentiator and its biggest trust challenge. Crypto users have been burned by yield promises (UST/Luna, Celsius, FTX "earn"). These seven tactics are specifically designed to make Flywheel's yield feel different — because it is different.

| # | Tactic | Implementation | Why It Works |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Show the source** | "Your deposits join the Aggregated Liquidity Pool. The Flywheel Solver uses this pool to fulfill intents in the LI.FI marketplace. 50% of intent-fulfillment rewards come to you." | Traceability. Users can understand where the money comes from — it's not "magic yield." |
| 2 | **Use small, real numbers** | "+$0.003 today" not "Earn 5% APY!" | Concrete amounts are more believable than percentage projections. Small numbers feel honest. |
| 3 | **Show the math** | Revenue Split panel: Intent-fulfillment rewards → 50% User / 50% Flywheel Treasury (used as pool liquidity and operations) | Transparency reduces suspicion. If you can see the split, the yield feels accountable. |
| 4 | **Acknowledge zero periods** | "$0.00 earned — yield begins when the solver captures its first spread" | Honesty about zero-yield periods proves the system is real, not inflated. |
| 5 | **Non-custodial yield** | "Your funds are locked in the Custody Contract (Yellow Smart Account / Nitrolite), not on our servers. The session key authorizes vault-internal state updates, not custody transfer. User funds are always protected." | Distinguishes from Celsius/FTX model where funds were held (and lost) by the company. |
| 6 | **Time-based proof** | Yield history chart showing actual daily/weekly/monthly earnings over time | A track record, even a short one, is more convincing than a promise. |
| 7 | **Protocol-absorbs-loss disclosure** | "Negative solver periods: yield shows $0 — the protocol absorbs losses from the treasury, never from your deposits." | The most powerful trust-builder: you can't lose yield. The worst case is zero, not negative. |
